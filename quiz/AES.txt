AES and Block Cipher


1. AES uses a ____________ bit block size and a key size of __________ bits.
a) 128; 128 or 256
b) 64; 128 or 192
c) 256; 128, 192, or 256
d) 128; 128, 192, or 256
Answer: d
Explanation: It uses a 128-bit block size and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits.


2. Like DES, AES also uses Feistel Structure.
a) True
b) False
Answer: b
Explanation: AES does not use a Feistel structure. Instead, each full round consists of four separate functions:
-byte substitution
-Permutation
-arithmetic operations over a finite field, and
-XOR with a key.


6. How many rounds does the AES-256 perform?
a) 10
b) 12
c) 14
d) 16
Answer: c
Explanation: AES 256 performs 14 rounds.


9. In AES the 4×4 bytes matrix key is transformed into a keys of size __________
a) 32 words
b) 64 words
c) 54 words
d) 44 words
Answer: d
Explanation: In AES the 4×4 bytes matrix key is transformed into a keys of size 44 bytes.
        
12. There is an addition of round key before the start of the AES round algorithms.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: In AES the final round contains only three transformations, and there is an initial single transformation (Add Round Key) before the first round which can be considered Round 0. Each transformation takes 4×4 matrices as input and produces a 4×4 matrix as output.

	Answer: c
Explanation: The Shift Rows transformation consists of:
-Not shifting the first row of the state array at all.
-Circularly shifting the second row by one byte to the left.
-Circularly shifting the third row by two bytes to the left, and
-Circularly shifting the last row by three bytes to the left.


1. How many computation rounds does the simplified AES consists of?
a) 5
b) 2
c) 8
d) 10
Answer: b
Explanation: The simplified AES has only 2 rounds of computation.


2. For the case of Mixed Columns and Inverse Mixed Columns, is it true that b(x) = a-1(x)mod(x4 + 1)
where a(x) = {03}x3 + {01}x2 + {01}x + {02} and b(x) = {0B}x3 + {0D}x2 + {09}x + {0E}
a) True
b) False. The expression for a(x) is wrong.
c) False. The expression for b(x) is wrong.
d) False. Both a(x) and b(x) are faulty.
Answer: a

8. Which of the following are true
i) In the AES key expansion algorithm, the function g() operates on w i+3
ii) Perform a one-byte right circular rotation on the argument 4-byte word
