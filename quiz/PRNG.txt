Answer: a
Explanation: TRNGs are not practical for stream ciphers.


2. A stream cipher key is usually of size ___ or 128 bits.
a) 56
b) 64
c) 54
d) 48
Answer: c
Explanation: A stream cipher key is usually of size 54 or 128 bits.


3. Which among the following has the lowest bitrate ?
a) PRF
b) TRNG
c) PRNG
d) All have the same bitrate
Answer: b
Explanation: TRNGs are the slowest. The mechanism used to generate True Random numbers may not be able to generate bits at a rate sufficient to keep up with the application requiring the random bits.


4. RC4 was built on the sole purpose of generating random bits i.e. to act as a PRNG.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a

Answer: a
Explanation: Runs Test is a test to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected.


7. Frequency Test is
a) a test to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected
b) a test to detect if a sequence can be significantly compressed without loss of information
c) a test for the check of evenness in the 1s and 0s
d) a test to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence is approx the same as in a truly random o/p
Answer: d
Explanation: Frequency Test is a test to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence is approx the same as in a truly random o/p.


8. We should not be able to determine the seed from any previous knowledge of the bits sequence. This is the property of backward unpredictability.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: The statement is true.


9. Forward Unpredictability is a property when the seed is unknown, and the next output bit is the sequence should be unpredictable.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: The statement is true.


10. A rule to check for a large number N being a prime number
a) by dividing N by every even integer less than N/2
b) by dividing N by every odd integer less than root(N)
c) by dividing N by every even integer less than root(N)
d) by dividing N by every integer less than N/2

a) Scalability
b) Uniformity
c) Stability
d) Consistency
Answer: b
Explanation: This is the property of Uniformity.


12. The property that any extracted subsequence should pass the test for randomness is
a) Scalability
b) Uniformity
c) Stability
d) Consistency
Answer: a
Explanation: Scalability is the property where any extracted subsequence should pass the test for randomness.


13. Using the Linear Congruential Method (LCM), for a=7, c=0 and m=32. The period is
a) 13
b) 4
c) 11
d) 7
Answer: b
Explanation: The sequence generated is {7,17,23,1,7..}. Thus the period is 4.


14. Using the Linear Congruential Method, for a=5, c=0 and m=32. The period is
a) 8
b) 4
c) 9
d) 11
Answer: a
Explanation: The sequence generated is {2,25,29,17,21,9,13,1,5,2…}. Thus the period is 8.

a) 2(31) – 1
b) 2(31)
c) 2(32)
d) 2(32) – 1
Answer: a
Explanation: Typically 2^(31) – 1 is chosen as the value for m (a large prime number).
