Explanation: DDoS is another leading attack type. Instead of implementing a single computer & its internet bandwidth, a DDoS utilizes various systems & their connections for flooding the targeted website.




8. There are ______ types of DoS attack.
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
Answer: a
Explanation: With the help of DoS attack attackers try to busy its users by flooding the URL of the victim with limitless requests. There are two types of DoS attack. These are Application Layer Attacks and Network Layer DoS attacks.




9. Application layer DoS attack is also known as _______________
a) Layer4 DoS attack
b) Layer5 DoS attack
c) Layer6 DoS attack
d) Layer7 DoS attack
Answer: d
Explanation: A DoS attack is a very dangerous threat for users who have their services running via the internet. The Application Layer DoS is also known as Layer-7 DoS attack.

a) Network Layer DoS
b) Physical Layer DoS
c) Transport Layer DoS
d) Application Layer DoS
Answer: d
Explanation: DoS attacks are of two types. These are Application Layer Attacks and Network Layer DoS attacks. Application Layer DoS is a type of DoS threats to overload a server as it sends a large number of requests requiring resources for handling & processing.

a) Layer3-4 DoS attack
b) Layer5 DoS attack
c) Layer6-7 DoS attack
d) Layer2 DoS attack
Answer: a
Explanation: Denial of Service attack becomes dangerous because it floods the target service over the internet. There are two types of DoS attack. The Network Layer DoS is also known as the Layer 3-4 DoS attack.
